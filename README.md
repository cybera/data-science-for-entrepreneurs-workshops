# Startup calgary workshop Jan 16, 2018

This is the repo for the Startup Calgary workshop presented by Cybera. In these notebook we go over some basic NLP covering the following topics 

1. Data cleaning and processing  of some messy messy Twitter bot data
2. Basic visualizations and statistics such as word maps, hashtag statistics, and user mention statistics.
3. Using word embeddings to create topic models using k-means, and using that topic model to identify specific clusters (topics) that you may be interested in

We also have included a very basic twitter bot code that you could implement yourself.
