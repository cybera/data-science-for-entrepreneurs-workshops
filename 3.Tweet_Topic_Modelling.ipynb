    "# Text Analysis With Twitter Data\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this tutorial series we've discussed at length how to clean and process Twitter data. We've also introduced aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP) such as word clouds and counting statistics. In this notebook, we're going to construct a topic model using **word vectors**, **word embeddings** and **K-means**. Using these methods, we will show you a few tricks in order to identify groups of tweets defining topics you're interested in. Such a model has applications for the identification of groups of users for targeted advertising,  or as a tool to quickly find relevant tweets to help quantify potential demand for a product/service. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "1. Turn our tweets into \"tweet\" vectors. \n",
    "2. Cluster those vectors to define topics.\n",
    "3. Use this model to locate topics relevant to us, and discuss how such a model may be used for market research or advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Preliminaries \n",
    "Before we get started, let's introduce a few concepts and background materials before diving into the materials. For this notebook we have two main concepts to cover: Word vectors and word embeddings. The introduction into k-means clustering will be saved for the relevant section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Word vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A word vector is the conversion of a word into a sparse 'one-hot' coded vector. What this means is that each word contained within our tweets is mapped to a unique vector with only a single non-zero element. For example, the word \"karate\" may appear as \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mbox{Karate} = \n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "0 \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "1 \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "0\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where it is represented as a _unique_ and _sparse_ vector that contains a single non-zero entry. The size of each word vector is the same and has size $N$, where $N$ is the number of words in our vocabulary. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A sentence vector is simply the word vector representation of sentence or in our case, a tweet. For example, the sentence\n",
    "``` \n",
    "wax on, wax off\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is the average of the vector sum of our word vectors for each word\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\vec{D}_1 = \\frac{1}{4} \\left(2\\vec{w}_1 + \\vec{w}_2 + \\vec{w_3}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the vector for `wax` was repeated in this particular example. What this means is that in sentence vectors **punctuation, and the order words appear is not important**. The vector representation of a sentence is the same. For example, the sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Turning words to math? That is lunacy! Why would you do that? \n",
    "```\n",
    "and\n",
    "```\n",
    "Turning math is lunacy! Why would you do that to words?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "would have an identical _vector_ representation, but are very clearly different sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Word Embeddings \n",
    "\n",
    "On their own, word vectors are often too large and sparse to be particularly useful. More importantly however, because word vectors are linearly independent (no combination of word vectors can be used to make a different word vector) understanding similarities between words (such as synonyms) and the similarities between sentences is impossible. How do we transform these vectors into a form that can be used to understand linguistic similarities? \n",
    "\n",
    "What we need to do is develop our word embeddings - a new set of vectors which can relate words and sentences based on their similarities. In our case, we're going to use what's known as a \"Neural Embedding\", or word embeddings that are a result of a neural network trained on text data. In most applications, a fully connected shallow neural network (A neural network with only a single hidden layer) is used, and the resulting parameter weights of the neural network define our _word embeddings_ or a series of **dense** vectors that represent the similarities between words. For our purposes we will be using a set of pre-trained word embeddings available [in this github repository](https://github.com/eyaler/word2vec-slim/blob/master/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300-SLIM.bin.gz). This is a small version of word embeddings resulting from training on Google News, and has a vocabulary of about 300,000 words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding of how these word embeddings came about is not required. However, for those interested in learning more, feel free to use the drop down menus below in order to understand how the neural network is used to create word embeddings. The first drop down is very high level, and the next two are quite technical. \n",

    "<h2> Word2Vec Word Embeddings </h2>\n",
    " \n",
    "In this section we will cover the basics of the model known as `word2vec` using what is known as the Continuous Bag Of Words (CBOW) model. In the CBOW model, our task is to predict \"missing\" words. For example, if we had the sentence \n",
    "```\n",
    "I sure do love learning about word embeddings! \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To train our network, we would remove a single word from the sentence above, say \"learning\". We would then try to predict the word \"learning\" given an input of the other words in the sentence. Schematically this is represented below \n",
    "\n",
    "![scheme](images/wor2vecschem.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we take the input context - the other words in our original sentence, and use those in order to predict the word that we've removed.  As words can exist in multiple contexts (among different sets of input words), this model can discover how different words are related to each other - with enough data we'll understand the \"relationships\" between words. What is nice about this model is that we have a massive _labeled_ data set for free: all we need to do is grab a bunch of text, and choose which word to remove at each step of training!\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait! At face value, this neural network doesn't sound like it's particularly useful - all it's doing is predicting a word based on some words we've given to it as input, we can't even use that outside of the texts we've given it! How is this network useful for understanding language? Well, we won't be using the neural network in the sense that we're using it \"online\" to create word embeddings. What we'll have from the training process is a set of internal parameters that relate our one-hot encoded vector to _all the other_ one hot encoded vectors. The closer these vectors of internal parameters are together, the more similar words are to each other. In the case of word embeddings, the network we use to create them is _only_ useful in terms of the weights it optimizes - not the output it produces.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that we will have word embeddings that represent the contextual similarities between words. Instead of using our simple one hot encoded vectors, we will now possess a vector formalism that can be used to understand things such as word similarity, and expand those to things like sentence and document similarity. \n",

In this case, the \"elbow\" is at approximately 77 topics, and for many applications, that may be the number of topics you wish to choose. However, for our analysis we're going to choose the full 200 as we have reason to believe that out of 20000 tweets, we probably have more than 77 topics at a given time. This is done below, however, feel free to experiment with the `n_clusters` parameter in the cell below and experiment with different topic models.

If you find a large group of tweets relevant to either your product or business, you can use those to understand how people are discussing those issues publicly. Either from a sentiment analysis to understand how people feel, as market research to understand what people seem to need, or to discover which users to target for advertising purposes. Of course, this is a minimal model and may not be perfect for answering those questions explicitly. However, understanding this model can act as a solid basis to iterate to more complex models which may see greater success in understanding your business problems via twitter text analysis. \n",

    "## Epilogue: Finding users in your topic \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you've found a group of tweets around a topic of interest for you or your business. Now, you might like to either contact those users directly, or target ads at them. How do we go about that? Well, our first step is to add those topic labels to our data frame. This is done below. "
