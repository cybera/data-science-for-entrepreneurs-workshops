    "# Text Analysis With Twitter Data\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this tutorial series we've discussed at length how to clean and process Twitter data. We've also introduced aspects of Natural Language Processing (NLP) such as word clouds and counting statistics. In this notebook, we will construct a topic model using **word vectors**, **word embeddings** and **K-means**. You will discover how to identify the topics that you're interested in analyzing. This model will have applications in the identification of groups of users for targeted advertising, or as a tool to quickly find relevant tweets to help quantify potential demand for a product/service. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "1. Turn our tweets into \"tweet\" vectors. \n",
    "2. Cluster those vectors to define topics.\n",
    "3. Use this model to locate relevant topics and discuss how such a model may be used for market research or advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis considers only tweets which were sent with location from Alberta, so things that \"trend\" in this data set may be different from things that trend on Twitter proper. **As well, we are missing tweets which did not have a location tag.**\n",
    "\n",
    "More importantly - the analysis below is strongest when considering topics that don't yield well to key words. For example, political themes, food, and sports tend to work well with the following analysis as the language surrounding those ideas is _variable_ enough that a key word search may not work, but _consistent_ enough that the language used to describe those things is similar. Where this analysis _will not_ perform well is in cases where a keyword search would be best. For example, if you're looking for tweets concerning shoes, a keyword of shoes/brands will work better than the analysis we're about to do. However, if you're searching for something more abstract like fashion, the analysis we will walk through in this notebook may perform better than a simple keywords search. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Preliminaries \n",
    " In this first section, we have two main concepts to cover: Word vectors and word embeddings. The introduction into k-means clustering will be saved for the relevant section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Word vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A word vector is the conversion of a word into a sparse, 'one-hot' coded vector. Each word contained within the selected tweets is mapped to a unique vector with only a single non-zero element. For example, the word \"karate\" may appear as \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mbox{Karate} = \n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "0 \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "1 \\\\\n",
    "\\vdots \\\\\n",
    "0\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, it is represented as a _unique_ and _sparse_ vector containing a single non-zero entry. The size of each word vector is $N$, where $N$ is the number of words in our vocabulary. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A sentence vector is simply  the word vector representation of sentence or in our case, a tweet. For example, the sentence\n",
    "``` \n",
    "wax on, wax off\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is just the vector sum of our word vectors for each word, or\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\vec{D}_1 = 2\\vec{w}_1 + \\vec{w}_2 + \\vec{w_3}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the vector for `wax` was repeated in this particular example. What this tells you is that, in sentence vectors, **punctuation and the order words appear is not important**. The vector representation of a sentence is the same. For example, the sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Turning words to math? That is lunacy! Why would you do that? \n",
    "```\n",
    "and\n",
    "```\n",
    "Turning that math to words is lunacy! Why would you do that?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "would have an identical _vector_ representation, even though they different sentences. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Word Embeddings \n",
    "\n",
    "On their own, word vectors are often too large and sparse to be particularly useful. More importantly, because word vectors are linearly independent (no combination of word vectors can be used to make a different word vector) understanding similarities between words and sentences is impossible. How do we transform these vectors into a form that can be used to understand linguistic similarities? \n",
    "\n",
    "What we need to do is develop our word embeddings - a new set of vectors that can relate words and sentences based on their similarities. In this case, we're going to use what's known as a \"Neural Embedding\", or word embeddings that are a result of a neural network trained on text data. In most applications, a fully connected shallow neural network (a neural network with only a single hidden layer) is used. The resulting parameter weights of the neural network define our _word embeddings_ or,  a series of **dense** vectors that represent the similarities between words. For this example, we will be using a set of pre-trained word embeddings available [in this github repository](https://github.com/eyaler/word2vec-slim/blob/master/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300-SLIM.bin.gz). This is a small version of word embeddings resulting from training on Google News, and has a vocabulary of about 300,000 words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how these word embeddings came about is not necessary. However, for those interested in learning more, you can use the drop-down menus below to find out how the neural network is used to create word embeddings. The first drop-down is very high level, and the next two are quite technical. \n",

    "<h2> Word2Vec Word Embeddings </h2>\n",
    " \n",
    "This section covers the basics of the model known as `word2vec` using what is known as the Continuous Bag Of Words (CBOW) model. In the CBOW model, our task is to predict \"missing\" words. For example, if we had the sentence \n",
    "```\n",
    "I sure do love learning about word embeddings! \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To train our network, we would remove a single word from the sentence above, say \"learning\". We would then try to predict the word \"learning\" given an input of the other words in the sentence. Schematically this is represented below: \n",
    "\n",
    "![scheme](images/wor2vecschem.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we take the input context - the other words in our original sentence, and use them to predict the word that we've removed.  As words can exist in multiple contexts (among different sets of input words), this model can discover how different words are related to each other - with enough data we'll understand the \"relationships\" between words. What is nice about this model is that we have a massive _labeled_ data set for free!\n",
    "\n",
    " At face value, this neural network doesn't sound like it's particularly useful - all it is doing is predicting one word based on some words we've given to it as input. We can't even use that outside of the texts we've given it. How is it useful for understanding language? What we're trying to get from the training process is a set of internal parameters that relate our one-hot encoded vector to _all the other_ one-hot encoded vectors. The closer these vectors of internal parameters are, the more similar words are to each other. In the case of word embeddings, the network we use to create them is _only_ useful in terms of the weights it optimizes - not the output it produces.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that we will have word embeddings that represent the contextual similarities between words. Instead of using our simple one hot encoded vectors, we will now possess a vector formalism that can be used to understand things such as word similarity, and expand those to things like sentence and document similarity. \n",
