    "# Wrangling Twitter data\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to start out with the raw Twitter data that was captured using the Tweepy tool on which you can read more about in [this notebook](tweepy_bot.ipynb). The data captured was restricted to tweets from Alberta from December 18 2018 to December 27 2018. \n",

    "In order to prep the data for analysis, we will \"wrangle\" the data to clean it and structure it into a more useful format. \n",

    "[Data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) \"is the process of transforming and mapping data from one \"raw\" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes such as analytics\" (Wikipedia).\n",

    "The purpose of data wrangling notebook is to transform complex data into a format that is easier to work with in order to focus on the analysis of data, rather than the wrangling in the next notebooks. \n",

    " - **Discovering**  - understanding the data\n",
    " - **Structuring** -  organizing the data\n",
    "     - Naming or renaming variables\n",
    "     - Changing the type of variables\n",
    "     - Creating new variables through functions of existing of variables\n",
    "     - Conditional processing of variables (i.e the values of new variable is based on the values of existing variables) \n",
    " - **Cleaning** \n",
    "     - Redesign the data into a usable/functional format and correct/remove any bad data\n",
